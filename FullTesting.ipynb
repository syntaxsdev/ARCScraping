How about camouflage uniforms that change with their surroundings? Perhaps holiday-light displays that flash changing messages might be nice? These are just a few of the elastic, light-weight electronic devices physicists at The University of Texas at Dallas are developing by weaving organic light-emitting displays (OLEDs) into textiles and clothing.Soon a person may reach into his or her pocket, pull out a handkerchief-like piece of plastic material, unfurl it to four times its size and place it on a wall to make electronic media presentations.The woven display might project Powerpoint presentations, websites, maps or other electronic media. It would be reusable â easily updated with fresh data at the possessorâs whim.Fourth-year physics doctoral candidate Chris Williams conducts research on OLEDs. He said such devices right now are among the most commercially promising applications to come from the intersection of physics, chemistry, engineering, and nanotechnology.Polymers, diodes and chips, oh my!A diode is an electronic device that has two electrodes or terminals and is used to convert alternating electric current into direct current, depending on which way the voltage is biased or supplied.Most work in organic LEDs stems from discoveries by Dr. Alan G. MacDiarmid, the Nobel Prize-winning professor here at UTD who created the prototype conducting polymer in 1977, as well as work done by scientists at Eastman-Kodak in the early Eighties.Polymers are long chains of carbon atoms with side groups typically composed of hydrogen, oxygen or nitrogen. Side groups containing other elements are also possible, but less common, Chris said.âFor a polymer to be able to conduct electric current, it must consist alternately of singe and double bonds between the carbon atoms. It must also be âdoped,â meaning electrons are removed (through oxidation) or introduced (through reduction). These âholesâ or extra electrons can move current along the molecule â it becomes electrically conductive,â a press release on MacDiarmidâs contribution to science said.Chris added, âSo although they are plastic â most people donât think of plastic as being conductive â these materials are. Certain plastics and certain polymers can carry current and also emit light.âThe physicistâs contribution involves analyzing the materials and understanding their properties and mechanics â how they behave and function â to determine ways to maximize efficiency.Physicists devise simple layered structures of metals and organic materials that can be placed on plastic substrates, creating a flexible, low-cost alternative to liquid crystal displays (LCDs).Making depositsSimple, low-temperature deposition methods â spin casting, vacuum evaporation, and sublimation, physical vapor deposition â make processing OLEDs commercially attractive when compared with LCDs, Chris said.âWith the polymeric materials, I dissolve dry polymer in a suitable solvent. I then take a substrate â either glass or plastic â and put it on a motorized plate. The plate pulls vacuum on the substrate to hold it in place and then begins to rotate. I take a dropper and drop some of the solution onto the substrate and the solution spreads out and makes a nice thin uniform film.âWith small molecules, I put them into a tungsten boat inside a vacuum chamber and apply voltage across the boat. Itâs resistively heated like a light bulb filament. The material, which is in a powder form, heats up and evaporates within the vacuum. I place the substrate above it so that some of that evaporated material accumulates on the substrate,â Chris said.The Clean Room and other neat facilitiesChrisâ work takes place in the lab in Berkner Hall, the NanoTech Institute, and the Clean Room in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science.âThe Clean Room itself has everything you can think of â characterization equipment, deposition equipment, vacuum chambers, photo and electron-beam lithography. Just about any semiconductor process can be done in the Clean Room,â Chris said.He had nothing but praise for his work environment.âThe facilities here â the NanoTech facilities in particular â are top notch. The machine I work on is a state-of-the-art deposition system. It actually consists of two vacuum chambers â one for organic deposition and one for metal materials. Each one is enclosed in its own glove box purged with argon so that the chamber opens up and is vented from the glove box.âThe devices and materials are prevented from being exposed to oxygen and moisture. We can take the devices out, package them, seal them up and never expose them to atmosphere. That alone helps us to eliminate the degradation of devices and eliminates problems associated with atmospheric exposure,â Chris said.Prior to UTDChris did his undergraduate work at Virginia Tech, in Blacksburg, where he majored in materials science and engineering.âIn my first summer job at Virginia Tech, I was doing what I am doing now, research on organic light-emitting diodes. I got my start working on that and working on a vacuum system â one a little more primitive than the one Iâm working on now. But nonetheless it gave me a background in vacuum science, which has been very valuable,â he said.A Virginia Tech professor helped Chris get a job working for Dr. Anvar Zakhidov, professor of physics at UTD. At the time, Zakhidov was at Honeywell International, which is headquartered in Morristown, New Jersey.âMy professor was interested in having me go up there for the summer between my sophomore and junior years to work on organic light-emitting diodes,â Chris said.Falling in with Zakhidov and meeting BaughmanWhen Chris graduated, he had some decisions to make.âI was looking to either stay where I was in Blacksburg, working as a grad student, or to explore other options.âAround that time I learned that Dr. Zakhidov, along with Dr. Ray Baughman, had left Honeywell, and were starting a nanotech research facility at UTD. I was very interested in that and got in contact with Dr. Zakhidov. He said theyâd be working on OLEDs and that I should join them. And so I did.âThat following January, just three weeks after I graduated, I started here as a student. Itâs been great. I picked the right place,â Chris said.âI think UTD is great, especially now,â Chris said. âI guarantee that the carbon nanotube sheets that were recently developed are not going to be the last big discovery made here. In another year, maybe less, Iâm sure there will be another round of interviews for Drs. Ray Baughman and Anvar Zakhidov related to something new. There are some big things going on here.âGetting publishedBecause of Chrisâ work with OLEDs and carbon nanotube sheets, heâs recently received some media attention. He has been interviewed and taped by The Associated Press concerning his research. And Chris hit another milestone last year: his first journal publication.âI have authored my first publication recently in the Journal of Luminescence. The work was related to effects of organic dopants on the luminescence of OLED structures. We use these dopant materials to increase the conductivity of the organic layers.âWe seek higher efficiency devices with lower turn-on voltage, but weâve found that the presence of these dopants in some cases can negatively effect the emission of the materials by quenching. We wanted to understand whatâs going on in those cases,â Chris said.Chris said that his work can often lead to more questions than answers.âWe want to do a second paper to study the effects of dopants on both electro luminescence and photo luminescence. Thatâs hopefully going to be published in Advanced Materials, a journal of materials science.âWe also are going to do a follow-up paper related to an article in Science about the carbon nanotube sheets. I built the structures â the polymeric LEDs â on top of these carbon nanotube sheets.âWe are going to do another paper thatâs going to involve both small molecule and polymeric devices. Weâre going to look at the injection properties and study more of the physics of whatâs going on as far as charge injection and emission,â Chris said.A bright and luminous futureWhen asked about his aspirations beyond UTD, Chris wasted no time.âI want to go to work for a company. I want to go into industrial research, either for a small startup firm or a large established company. Iâm wide open to the possibilities. Eventually, Iâd like to wind up back in academia as a professor at some point and teach.Contact UsThe University of Texas at Dallas\\r\\t\\t\\t\\tSchool of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, FN32\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t800 W.

Dr. Williams also directs the DREAMSLab at Virginia Tech (Design, Research and Education for additive manufacturing Systems), which contains eight different 3D printers representing five different 3D printing technologies.\\xa0A strong proponent of additive manufacturing and 3D printing, Dr. Williams was interested in developing a way for K-12 STEM teachers to bring the technology to their schools. As part of its outreach program, the DREAMSLab holds 3D printing workshops for K-12 STEM teachers at the National Science Foundation (NSF) center for e-designâs Research Experience for Teachers (RET). During the week-long session, the teachers are given an Afinia Desktop 3D Printer to use and take with them for their students. Here are a few images of STEM teachers working on their Afinia 3D printers in a past session.According to the National Science Foundation, (NSF) âThe goal is to help build long-term collaborative partnerships between K-12 STEM teachers, college faculty, and the NSF university research community by involving the teachers and college faculty in engineering research and helping them translate their research experiences and new knowledge into classroom activities.âOn October 1, 2012, Dr. Williams received $450,000 in NSF funding for an innovation-based manufacturing program with the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Part of these funds were put to use by developing and hosting several dozen high school STEM teachers for a week of intense in-service training on how to introduce 3D printing into their classrooms.According to the NSF, âThe Directorate for Engineering (ENG) and the Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) program supports the active involvement of K-12 STEM teachers and college faculty in order to bring knowledge of engineering, and technological innovation into their classrooms.âDr. Williams said, âWhat really gets me excited about additive manufacturing is that it can fundamentally change the way we design products and get young people excited. For example, we have a group of mechanical engineering students who are re-designing an autonomous quadCopter. Their intricate honeycomb superstructure is very lightweight, very strong and could only be made with 3D printing. No longer are we constrained by traditional manufacturing and their rule sets.âDr. Williams has a Renaissance-Man view of what engineers will need to know in the future. The traditional ping-pong approach of a design engineer and a manufacturing engineer sending models back-and-forth is outdated. The engineer of the future will be educated in, not only design, but additive manufacturing, material science and ergonomics. âThe designer will be the manufacturer and vice versa.â is one of Dr. Williamsâ favorite statements.Hereâs an example of why this process is needed: Dr. Williams had a group of engineering students that asked, âWhy am I carrying around this mass of keys? What if we could design a swiss-army-like device that we could use instead?âDr. Williams said, âThey came up with a beautiful design that won a Best In Show. As a reward, we printed it in our DREAMSLab. The model came out wonderfully, except that it was about 4-1/2â long. Now, when they saw it on a CAD screen it looked great. When they put it in their pocket it just didnât work. Designs need to be created in an environment where they are more closely coupled to manufacturing capability and the end-userâs application.âGiven his large amount of additive manufacturing experience, Dr. Williamsâ DREAMSLab is the go-to source at Virginia Tech for engineers who need sophisticated 3D models to further their research.\\xa0 The DREAMSLab mantra: âIf you can design it, we can make it!âAbout Dr. Chris Williams, Ph.D.Dr. Chris Williams, Ph.D. is an Assistant Professor at Virginia Techâs College of Engineering in the Department of Engineering Education.

Randolph Professor of Mechanical Engineering, has been named a\\xa0senior member\\xa0of the\\xa0National Academy of Inventors\\xa0(NAI).\\xa0NAI senior members are active faculty, scientists, and administrators from NAI Member Institutions whose innovation-producing technologies have brought, or aspire to bring, real impact on the welfare of society. They also have growing success in patents, licensing, and commercialization, while educating and mentoring the next generation of inventors.The 2022 class of senior members represents 41 research universities and government and nonprofit research institutes. They are named inventors on over 1,093 issued U.S. patents. Williams is among 83 academic inventors named to the 2022 cohort, which also includes Virginia Tech's\\xa0John Robertson, research professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Mechanics.\\xa0The senior member level is a step toward becoming a fellow, the groupâs highest distinction, with\\xa01,403 fellows worldwide.NAI senior memberships are nominated by an existing NAI Senior Member, after which individuals undergo a rigorous selection process by the NAI Senior Member Advisory Committee.\\xa0New senior members are elected annually on National Inventorsâ Day (Feb. 11).\\xa0Williams has excelled in the field of additive manufacturing (also called 3D printing), establishing himself as a pioneer from the earliest days of the technologyâs appearance on the Virginia Tech campus. He is the director of the\\xa0Design, Research, and Education for Additive Manufacturing Systems (DREAMS) Lab, which maintains a steady stream of innovation and industry partnerships.\\xa0He joined the faculty of the Department of Mechanical Engineering in 2008, was named a\\xa0John R. Jones III Faculty Fellow\\xa0in 2017,\\xa0 and was named the\\xa0L.S. Randolph Professor\\xa0in 2020.\\xa0He holds four patents and has several under review.He has authored more than 200 peer-reviewed publications and served as primary investigator or co-primary investigator on more than $25 million of externally funded research.\\xa0The DREAMS Lab has grown rapidly since Williams arrived on campus, filling two large rooms in Goodwin Hall and adding the capacity for 3D printing materials such as copper, latex, and Kapton.\\xa0Projects have been sponsored by the National Science Foundation, the Office of Naval Research, the Department of Energy, and industry partners, among others.DREAMS Lab Team. Photo by Alex Parrish for Virginia Tech.âAs a kid dreaming of one day becoming an engineer, I set having a single patent as a 'bucket list' -level achievement,â said Williams. âNow, having the experience to work on multiple inventions and to receive this honor is honestly hard for me to believe. This recognition is not possible without the excellent student researchers and faculty collaborators that I have had the honor to work with here at Virginia Tech. I consider myself fortunate to have the opportunity to research the future of additive manufacturing while working alongside its future leaders.âWilliams has served as a mentor to those future leaders, working with a host of graduate and undergraduate researchers. Undergraduate mentees include two senior design teams and an undergraduate group that came together in the DREAMS lab for a project that was awarded a $75,000 grant from NASA.Graduate student Lindsey Bezek has worked with Williams since 2014, and is now completing her Ph.D. under Williams' guidance.\\xa0\\xa0The opportunity to do research in the DREAMS lab, from undergraduate research to my senior design project and now through my Ph.D. research, has been a one-of-a-kind opportunity to work in an internationally-recognized facility with an inspiring mentor, Bezek said. Dr. Williams genuinely cares about all of his students - their research, their career goals, their success - and he provides individualized advising to help each student's professional growth. Under his guidance, I have learned how to become a better researcher, while improving skills such as writing and presenting, that will prepare me for success in my future career path.\\xa0 As additive manufacturing has evolved over the years, Dr. Williams has invested energy and enthusiasm to continue to learn, explore new ideas, and advance the state of the art for several additive manufacturing processes. He has built a lab culture that encourages experimentation, embraces innovation, and values outreach.\\xa0 His curiosity and passion are what guarantees the sustainability of innovative research in his lab.Williams has used his lab to model the university motto of Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) by mobilizing his team to produce reusable respirators during the earliest days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The mask could be rapidly reproduced during a critical period of the coronavirus outbreak where the demand for personal protective gear far outpaced supplies, providing a backup that could be created on 3D printers.Williams also serves as chair of the Additive Manufacturing Community Leadership Committee within the Society of Manufacturing Engineers. He was the recipient of an NSF CAREER Award in 2013 and named a Faculty Fellow of the Virginia Tech College of Engineering in 2015.We are very proud of Dr. Williams for receiving this recognition,â said Corina Sandu, acting head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering. âHis career has been exciting to watch, and many of his peers consider him one of the top experts in his field. He is more than deserving of this award.âContact:                                            Emily Roediger                                                        540-231-2108TagsCollege of EngineeringFaculty ExcellenceGraduate EducationHonors and AwardsMechanical EngineeringResearchTop NewsShare this storyShare on FacebookShare on TwitterCopy address link to clipboard  Related ContentArticle\\xa0Item            Charlie Phlegar promoted to senior vice president for advancement                        , articleArticle\\xa0Item            Research conference draws undergraduates to campus from universities across the South and Midwest                        , articleVideo\\xa0Item            Hoda Kotb '86 reflects on her Virginia Tech experience                        , videoRelated ContentArticle\\xa0Item            Research conference draws undergraduates to campus from universities across the South and Midwest                        , articleArticle\\xa0Item            Virginia Tech recognizes employees for 15,975 years of combined service                        , articleVideo\\xa0Item            Undergraduates get hands-on experience in mine ventilation lab                        , videoGlobal Land Grant ImpactVirginia Tech demonstrates impact as a global land grant â progressing sustainability in our community, through the Commonwealth of Virginia, and around the world.
